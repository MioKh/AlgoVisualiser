#Algorithms visualiser

So i am basically learning about algorithms and I think its very intresting if i made them very visual on how they are working it both improves my understanding of the algorithm itself and javascript

for now I am not going to do a lot since i am still learning the algorithms and i didnt think about how to implement them visually
